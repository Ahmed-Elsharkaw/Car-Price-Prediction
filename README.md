# Car-price-prediction
Preprocessing:
Dropping segment and color columns
Filling Nan values by mode in Drive unit column
Filling Nan values by mean in Volume column
Applying str.lower() function to (drive unit , Volume,FuelType) Columns
Splitting Car-info columns into 3 column (brand , model , year) then dropping brand and model columns

Adding (mean Price) price column by getting the  mean price for every unique value in car-info column from price(USD) column 
Storing values in dictionary(Every Unique value in car info ,meanPrice)
Storing mean price of each brand in a dictionary (brand,MeanPrice)

testing preprocessing :
Mean Price Column is filled according to 4 scenarios 
1 – our dictionary has the car-info key then we simply  return the mean price
2 – our dictionary has same brand and model in car-info key but year is different then we simply return the mean price of closest year difference of same model 
3 – our dictionary has same brand in car info key but model is different we simply return the mean price of brand
4-our dictionary has doesn’t contain Brand then we simply return mean price of Price(usd) column 

categorical encoding:
We apply hot one encoding to 4 columns (condition , fuel type, transmission, drive unit)

scalling:
We apply feature scaling to 3 coulmns (mean price – volume - mileage) using sklearn standard scaling
